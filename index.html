      <p>
        Today marks the day of my first blog post! I really need to find a
        better title. Today I finall figured out git controls and repositories
        on GitHub, so I've been able to practice creating branches and
        committing them to my repo. Now that I have actually started using it, I
        can see how helpful it can get. I'm going to have to adopt or create a
        solid system for naming the commits though. Today I made the header look
        pretty solid, and I did some good old googling to figure out the
        opacity. It's fun seeing everything come together. I'm going to use this
        blog to continue documenting my progress and giving updates on my
        learning and productivity. L8r Sk8rs
